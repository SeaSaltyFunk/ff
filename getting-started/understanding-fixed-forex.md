# Understanding Fixed Forex

Getting started with Fixed Forex can be confusing, there is a lot to take in and understand. This small guide is intended for beginners with a base understanding of non-USD currencies (Forex), DeFi, and Crypto. It tries to answer recurring questions about how to get started with Fixed Forex and how it works or makes money for vested $KP3R token holders or ib Asset.

## What is Fixed Forex?

Fixed Forex is the name for the forex issuance solution from the Keep3r network, it allows users access to decentralized non-USD denominated stablecoins on ETH mainnet&#x20;

Fixed Forex assets are [ERC-20 tokens ](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)representing fiat currencies that include;

* $ibEUR - the Eurozone fiat currency
* $ibCHF - Swiss Franc
* $ibGBP - Pound Sterling
* $ibAUD - Australian Dollar
* $ibJPY - Japanese Yen
* $ibKRW - Korean Won

Fixed Forex stablecoins are over-collateralized, meaning that each stablecoin issued must be backed by collateral maintained at a ratio greater than the fiat value of the stablecoins borrowed. Fixed Forex utilizes the [Iron Bank protocol](https://app.ib.xyz/markets/Ethereum) for the issue & minting of new Fixed Forex assets.

## Where's the Whitepaper?

Fixed Forex was created as a fair launch project without a whitepaper pre-publish.

Fixed Forex launched July 21 via an announcement on Medium by Andre Cronje. The project was a fair launch project that later consolidated the Keep3r on-chain Jobs registry, option liquidity mining & Fixed Forex projects under a single liquidity ecosystem represented by the $KP3R token.

## What is the $KP3R token?

The $KP3R token is a representation of the single liquidity ecosystem that includes Fixed Forex. It has two main uses for Fixed Forex users; staking and voting

In order to use $KP3R to stake or vote, token holders must lock $KP3R and, in return, will receive $vKP3R

More details about the $KP3R token, $vKP3R and the tokenomics are included in the [$KP3R token section](broken-reference)

## Are Fixed Forex Assets on other L1's or L2's?

No, Fixed Forex assets are currently limited to ETH mainnet

## Where can I find the smartcontracts?

All smartcontracts associated with Fixed Forex can be found in the [Developers section](broken-reference)

## Risks

Although security audits have been completed it's possible that a vulnerability could be found in the FIxed Forex smart contracts.

Fixed Forex also utilizes the lending contracts of the Iron Bank protocol, whilst users may also interact with Curve, Convex, Yearn & Synthetix smart contract protocols in making use of Fixed Forex assets. Users should be aware of exposure to further risk in these areas.

Fixed Forex governance is managed by the Keep3r Multisig, who's role is further explained in the [Goveranance section](broken-reference).
