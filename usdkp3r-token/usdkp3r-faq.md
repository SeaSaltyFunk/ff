# $KP3R FAQ

## What is the current supply?

"Current" supply can have dual meanings, we'd encourage users to read and understand the difference between Circulating Supply & Total Supply as described in the [$KP3R Tokenomics Section](usdkp3r-tokenomics.md)

Current Total Supply can be checked within the [$KP3R token smart contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1ceb5cb57c4d4e2b2433641b95dd330a33185a44) or via "Run" in this [Dune Analytics query](https://dune.com/queries/1265393)

## What makes the total supply increase?

New $KP3R is constantly minted as part of the tokenomics design. Please refer to [Montary Policy Section](usdkp3r-tokenomics.md#monetary-policy) to understand more

## What is the maximum supply?

$KP3R has no hard cap on maximum supply, similar to Ethereum, as such total supply will steadily increase over time
