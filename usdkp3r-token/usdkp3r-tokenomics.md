# $KP3R Tokenomics

## Monetary Policy

$KP3R has an inflationary supply, creating new token emissions through isolated liquidity mints. These are distributed in the following ways;

1. The creation of new $KP3R distributed as Options Liquidity Mining Rewards for incentivizing liquidity of Fixed Forex Assets
2. The creation of new $KP3R distributed to vested token holders as Options Liquidity Mining Rewards
3. &#x20;The creation of new $KP3R via the Keep3r Network credit minting process

Each isolated liquidity mint has a weekly cap target, which is controlled & reviewed through governance power by a Multisig. Currently, these are;

* Keep3r Jobs - limit of up to 1k $KP3R per week
* Fixed Forex Asset liquidity incentives - limit of up to 1k $KP3R per week
* Vested Token Holders - limit of up to 1k $KP3R per week

_Note; actual new mint & emissions may vary & skew lower or higher each week._

Governance of new liquidity mints is controlled by the Multisig. For more detail on Multisig responsibilities please check the [Governance Section](broken-reference)

Additionally, the Multisig may optionally mint new $KP3R for utilizing treasury funds to sustain growth of the protocol
